# Azure Hours Databricks Day - 8/2/2019
Welcome to our landing page for our Databricks 101 tour for US EDU Azure Hour. We'll walk through three different tasks and familiarize ourselves with Azure Databricks. 

Keep in mind that our objective is **just** to familiarize ourselves, not to go very deep. Additional information on the Azure Databricks platform (like all our platforms in Azure) can be found on our [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/) site.

## Getting Started with Data Constructs
1. Refer to the [Lab 1 PDF guide]("databricks-intro\Databricks_Labs\Lab 1 - Getting Started with Spark.pdf") to get setup on reading both the older Resilient Distributed Dataset and the newer Dataframe data constructs in Spark. [NOTE: Refer to the Setup Guide to setup the prerequisite storage accounts and clusters](../Databricks_Labs/Setup Guide.pdf)
